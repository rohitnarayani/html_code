    <pre> Use your favorite jar of salsa (or try homemade salsa) to give simple chicken breasts big flavor. <br>
        "Very easy and very quick, yet it tastes so good people will think you slaved for hours over this dish, <br>
        " says reviewer Jillian.

    <pre>This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! <br> Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, and it has become a household favorite. Depending on your taste, you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa.
         I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.</pre>
